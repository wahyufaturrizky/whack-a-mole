## Notes

The goal is to have moles appear in random holes for random amounts of time. The tally of clicked-on moles is also logged.

First, select the holes, moles, and scoreboard.

Create a function, `randomTime`, which takes a min and max time, and returns a random time between them.

```js
function randomTime(min, max) {
  return Math.round(Math.random() * (max - min) + min);
}
```

Create another function, `randomHole`, which takes in a list of holes and selects one at random.

`holes` is a NodeList that contains the six holes.

Set a variable, `hole`, to `holes[idx]`.

You will run into a problem in that it could return the same hole twice in a row.

Create a let variable, `lastHole`.

At the end of the function let `lastHole` = `hole`. This will save a reference to the previous hole and allow you to check.

If `hole` equals `lastHole` run the function again.

If `hole` doesn't equal `lastHole`, return `hole`. Otherwise, return `randomHole(holes)`.

Create a function, `peep`, which will cause the moles to pop up.

Select a random time (between 200ms and 1s) and a random hole.

Take the random hole and add a class of `up` to it. This will trigger the CSS to animate it in.

But, they will stay up. To remedy this, use `setTimeout` to remove the class after the random time is complete.

```js
function peep() {
  const time = randomTime(200, 1000);
  const hole = randomHole(holes);
  hole.classList.add("up");
  setTimeout(() => {
    hole.classList.remove("up");
    if (!timeUp) peep();
  }, time);
}
```

At this stage `peep()` will run indefinitely.

Create a variable, `timeUp`, and set it to false.

Make a function, `startGame`.

Restart the scoreboard, set `timeUp` equal to false, and call `peep()`.

Use a `setTimeout` to set `timeUp` to false after 10 seconds.

Finally, when you click on a mole, it needs to bonk them on the head.

Make a function, `bonk`, which takes in an event.

Take all of the moles and listen for a click on each of them.

On all events is a property called `isTrusted`. If you fake clicking something, e.g., using JavaScript, this will be false.

If `e` is not `isTrusted` then return.

Create a let variable, score, equal to 0.

Inside `bonk()`, increment `score`, remove the `up` class, and set the text content of `scoreBoard` to `score`.

```js
function bonk(e) {
  if (!e.isTrusted) return; // Catch cheaters faking clicks
  score++;
  this.classList.remove("up");
  scoreBoard.textContent = score;
}
```
